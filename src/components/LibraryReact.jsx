            <h1>React JS & React Native</h1>
            <p>React JS is probably the technology I have felt the most comfortable using. Learning it was easy, and designing cool, useful and smooth UI's made more sense given this powerful tool. I have learned to use hooks such as Location, State, Context, Reducer, Redux and more. On the other hand, I've liked exploring for new dependencies that integrate to React to facilitate animation creation and integration in projects. Currently, I have registered on UDEMY for a REACT NATIVE course which, I'm sure, it will bring my skills to the next level. I will be a React mind freak, that I know.</p>
